## What is Disctopia?

Disctopia is an open source Python Discord Bot that works as a backdoor that you can control from a Discord server. It uses the **Discord API** to communicate between the agent and the Discord server.

## How does it work?

The Disctopia backdoor is made using the Discord API. That executable backdoor that gets generated is a Discord Bot that connects to a Discord server where you can control it. 
This connection stays undetected because it is considered normal discord traffic.

New clients that execute the backdoor are called **"Agents"**. Every Agent gets a unique ID that can be used to call the backdoor.
